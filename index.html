            <h1> Dream Big</h1>
            <h3> To become best photographer in Bangladesh </h3>
            <P class="justify"> without a doubt, being a highly respected photographer would be my dream career. The
                type of job that
                wouldn 't feel like a job because it is one of my favorite hobbies. Growing up I always noticed how much
                longer I took to take a picture of someone than when they did the same for me. I soon realized that I
                actually had a passion for getting the right shot that I understood that not every pictures the same and
                that certain angles made others look better in places. The praise I received for taking a lot of these
                pictures motivated me. I liked that I hardly ever got told to take these pictures over and I loved that
                I was always the one chosen to take them time after time</P>
